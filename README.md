ðŸš¨ Hotel Booking Cancellation Dashboard | Excel Project ðŸ“Š
I recently worked with a hotel booking dataset containing over 119,000 records from City and Resort Hotels spanning July 2015 to August 2017. Each record represents an individual booking â€” including both completed stays and cancellations.
To visualize key trends and insights, I built an interactive Excel dashboard featuring:
ðŸ“Š A bar graph showcasing cancellation patterns
ðŸ¥§ A pie chart displaying booking distribution
ðŸ§© A slicer for easy filtering
ðŸ–¼ A relevant visual/image to enhance storytelling
The dataset has anonymized all sensitive customer and hotel identifiers. Additionally, synthetic fields such as 'name', 'email', 'phone number', and 'credit_card' were generated for demonstration purposes only.
This project helped me explore data storytelling, Excel visualization skills, and cancellation trends in the hospitality industry. ðŸš€
